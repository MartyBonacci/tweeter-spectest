# Specification Quality Checklist: Tweet Posting and Feed System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - **Status:** PASS - Spec focuses on user requirements and behavior, not implementation (mentions "session-based auth" and "database" conceptually but not specific libraries)

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - **Status:** PASS - User stories clearly articulate value proposition (sharing thoughts, discovering content)

- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - **Status:** PASS - Uses plain language, explains features from user perspective

- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - **Status:** PASS - All template sections filled with relevant, detailed content

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - **Status:** PASS - Zero clarification markers; all decisions made with documented assumptions

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - **Status:** PASS - Each requirement has clear acceptance criteria (e.g., "140 characters", "newest first", "authenticated users only")

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - **Status:** PASS - Includes specific metrics (30 seconds to post, 2 seconds feed load, 100% invalid rejection, 0 XSS vulnerabilities)

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - **Status:** PASS - Success metrics focus on user experience and outcomes (load time, posting speed) not technical implementation

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - **Status:** PASS - Three complete user flows documented (post tweet, view feed, view detail) with step-by-step acceptance criteria

- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - **Status:** PASS - Covers empty tweets, over-limit tweets, whitespace-only, invalid IDs, unauthenticated posting attempts

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - **Status:** PASS - "Won't Have" section explicitly excludes editing, deletion, replies, likes, media, hashtags, search, analytics

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - **Status:** PASS - Dependencies section lists feature 001 prerequisite; Assumptions section documents 7 key design decisions

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - **Status:** PASS - Each P0 requirement includes success condition and measurable criteria

- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - **Status:** PASS - Three user stories cover posting, feed viewing, and detail viewing with complete acceptance criteria

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - **Status:** PASS - Success metrics directly align with functional requirements and user stories

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - **Status:** PASS - Maintains technology-agnostic language (mentions "character validation" not "Zod schema", "database storage" not "PostgreSQL table")

## Quality Score: 100/100

**All validation items passed âœ“**

- Zero clarifications needed - all decisions made with reasonable defaults
- Assumptions section documents 7 key design decisions including public feed, immutability, chronological ordering
- Security analysis comprehensive covering XSS, SQL injection, spam, and unauthorized access
- Clear dependency on Feature 001 (User Authentication System)
