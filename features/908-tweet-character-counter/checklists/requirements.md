# Specification Quality Checklist: Tweet Character Counter

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes:**
- Spec appropriately references existing tech stack (React, TypeScript) only in Technical Requirements section where necessary for type definitions
- Primary focus is on user experience and functional requirements
- Business value clearly articulated in Summary and User Stories sections

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes:**
- All requirements include specific, testable acceptance criteria
- Success metrics focus on user-facing outcomes (zero lag, correct behavior in 100% of cases)
- Edge cases covered: exactly 140 characters, exceeding limit, editing back under limit
- Out of scope items explicitly listed (configurable limits, different user types, etc.)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes:**
- Three user stories with comprehensive acceptance criteria
- Complete user flow documented from composition to submission
- Success metrics are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Technical Requirements section appropriately separated from functional requirements

## Validation Summary

**Status**: PASSED âœ“

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for planning phase.

**Key Strengths:**
1. Clear, measurable acceptance criteria for all requirements
2. Comprehensive accessibility requirements
3. Well-defined three-state color system (default/warning/exceeded)
4. Explicit out-of-scope items prevent scope creep
5. Security properly addressed (client-side UX only, server validates)

**Ready for next phase**: `/specswarm:plan`
