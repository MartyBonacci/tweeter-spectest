# Specification Quality Checklist: Tweet Like Functionality

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - **Status:** PASS - Spec focuses on user behavior and requirements, not implementation (mentions "database constraint" and "optimistic UI" conceptually but not specific libraries or frameworks)

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - **Status:** PASS - User stories clearly articulate engagement value (showing appreciation, gauging popularity)

- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - **Status:** PASS - Uses plain language accessible to product managers and business stakeholders

- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - **Status:** PASS - All template sections filled with comprehensive, relevant content

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - **Status:** PASS - Zero clarification markers; all decisions made with documented assumptions

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - **Status:** PASS - Each requirement has clear acceptance criteria (e.g., "one like per user", "real-time updates", "cascade delete")

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - **Status:** PASS - Includes specific metrics (< 1 second to like, < 100ms perceived latency, 100% duplicate rejection, 0 unauthorized likes)

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - **Status:** PASS - Success metrics focus on user experience outcomes (interaction speed, correctness) not technical implementation

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - **Status:** PASS - Three complete user flows documented (like, unlike, view counts) with step-by-step acceptance criteria including optimistic updates

- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - **Status:** PASS - Covers duplicate likes, rapid clicks, unauthorized unlikes, non-existent tweets, unauthenticated attempts

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - **Status:** PASS - "Won't Have" section explicitly excludes user lists, other reaction types, like analytics, privacy controls

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - **Status:** PASS - Dependencies section lists features 001 and 002 as prerequisites; Assumptions section documents 7 key design decisions

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - **Status:** PASS - Each P0 requirement includes success condition and measurable criteria

- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - **Status:** PASS - Three user stories cover liking, unliking, and viewing counts with complete acceptance criteria

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - **Status:** PASS - Success metrics directly align with functional requirements and user stories

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - **Status:** PASS - Maintains technology-agnostic language (mentions "unique constraint" not "PostgreSQL UNIQUE INDEX", "optimistic updates" not "React useState")

## Quality Score: 100/100

**All validation items passed âœ“**

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- Zero clarifications needed - all decisions made with reasonable defaults
- Assumptions section documents 7 key design decisions including public counts, optimistic UI, cascade deletes
- Security analysis comprehensive covering unauthorized manipulation, count inflation, and race conditions
- Clear dependencies on Features 001 (Auth) and 002 (Tweets)
- Excellent consideration of optimistic UI patterns for real-time feel
- Recommended next step: `/spectest:plan`
