# Specification Quality Checklist: User Profile Tweets Feed

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [../spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All checklist items validated

### Detailed Review:

#### Content Quality ✅
- **No implementation details**: Spec focuses on WHAT users need, not HOW to implement. Technical Requirements section appropriately references existing tech stack (TypeScript, Zod) as project standards, not implementation choices.
- **User value focused**: All requirements tied to user stories and benefits.
- **Non-technical language**: Summary, User Stories, and Functional Requirements readable by business stakeholders.
- **Complete sections**: All mandatory sections from template are filled.

#### Requirement Completeness ✅
- **No clarifications needed**: All requirements are clear. Feature reuses existing components and endpoints, so no ambiguity.
- **Testable requirements**: Each P0 requirement has specific acceptance criteria (e.g., "reverse chronological order", "No tweets yet" message).
- **Measurable success criteria**:
  - "Users can view any profile and see that user's tweets in under 2 seconds" (time-based)
  - "95%+ test coverage for new loader logic" (percentage-based)
  - "Zero security vulnerabilities introduced" (count-based)
- **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: Focused on user experience outcomes, not implementation details.
- **Acceptance scenarios**: Three user stories with complete acceptance criteria covering primary flow, empty state, and own profile.
- **Edge cases identified**: Empty state (no tweets), own profile view, loading states, error handling.
- **Scope bounded**: "Won't Have" section explicitly excludes pagination (moved to P2), filtering, pinned tweets, retweets.
- **Dependencies clear**: Lists all prerequisites (existing profile route, TweetCard, API endpoint).

#### Feature Readiness ✅
- **Clear acceptance criteria**: Each user story has 3-6 specific, testable criteria.
- **User scenarios complete**: Three flows documented: primary viewing, empty state, own profile.
- **Measurable outcomes**: Success metrics define completion (performance, test coverage, security).
- **No implementation leakage**: Spec describes requirements without prescribing solutions.

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/specswarm:plan`
- No clarifications needed - feature leverages existing codebase patterns
- All technical details appropriately scoped to "Technical Requirements" section
- Consider pagination (P2) during planning phase if performance testing shows need
