**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - **Status:** PASS - Spec focuses on user requirements and behavior, not implementation (mentions "external service" and "image upload" conceptually but not Cloudinary specifics in requirements)

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - **Status:** PASS - User stories clearly articulate identity and personalization value (expressing personality, discovering others)

- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - **Status:** PASS - Uses plain language accessible to product managers and business stakeholders

- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - **Status:** PASS - All template sections filled with comprehensive, relevant content

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - **Status:** PASS - Zero clarification markers; all decisions made with documented assumptions

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - **Status:** PASS - Each requirement has clear acceptance criteria (e.g., "0-160 characters", "own profile only", "direct URL accessible")

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - **Status:** PASS - Includes specific metrics (< 2 seconds profile load, < 30 seconds bio edit, < 5 seconds avatar upload, 100% authorization, 0 data exposure)

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - **Status:** PASS - Success metrics focus on user experience outcomes (load time, edit time) not technical implementation

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - **Status:** PASS - Three complete user flows documented (view own profile, edit profile, view others) with detailed step-by-step acceptance criteria

- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - **Status:** PASS - Covers empty bio, no avatar, invalid file types, unauthorized edits, non-existent usernames

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - **Status:** PASS - "Won't Have" section explicitly excludes username changes, privacy controls, followers, badges, profile themes, analytics

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - **Status:** PASS - Dependencies section lists features 001 and 002 as prerequisites plus Cloudinary; Assumptions section documents 8 key design decisions

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - **Status:** PASS - Each P0 requirement includes success condition and measurable criteria

- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - **Status:** PASS - Three user stories cover viewing own profile, editing profile, and viewing others with complete acceptance criteria

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - **Status:** PASS - Success metrics directly align with functional requirements and user stories

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - **Status:** PASS - Maintains technology-agnostic language (mentions "external service" not "Cloudinary SDK", "image validation" not "multer middleware")

## Quality Score: 100/100

**All validation items passed âœ“**
