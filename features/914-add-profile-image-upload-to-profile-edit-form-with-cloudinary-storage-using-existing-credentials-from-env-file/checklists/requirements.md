# Specification Quality Checklist: Profile Image Upload

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is complete and ready for the planning phase.

### Details:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification focuses on user needs (easy avatar upload) and business value (better UX). Written in accessible language with clear "What/Why/Who" structure.

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - All functional requirements include testable acceptance criteria
   - Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "upload in under 10 seconds", "95% success rate")
   - Edge cases covered (invalid files, large files, unauthorized access)
   - Scope clearly bounded with "Won't Have" section

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - Primary and secondary user stories with acceptance criteria
   - Complete user flows including error scenarios
   - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers needed
   - Dependencies identified (Cloudinary credentials already exist)

## Notes

The specification leverages existing infrastructure (Cloudinary credentials, JWT auth, profiles table) and clearly defines the file upload enhancement to the existing profile edit functionality. Ready to proceed to `/specswarm:plan`.
