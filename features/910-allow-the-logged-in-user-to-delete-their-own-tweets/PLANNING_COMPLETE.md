## Tech Stack Validation Results

**Status:** ✅ **100% APPROVED** - No tech stack changes required

### Approved Technologies Used

All technologies in this feature were pre-approved in `/memory/tech-stack.md`:

| Technology | Purpose | Status |
|------------|---------|--------|
| TypeScript 5.x | Type safety | ✅ Core technology |
| React Router v7 | useFetcher for optimistic updates | ✅ Core framework |
| Zod | API validation | ✅ Standard library |
| Express | DELETE endpoint | ✅ Core backend |
| postgres | Database operations | ✅ Standard library |
| JWT (httpOnly cookies) | Authentication | ✅ Security standard |
| Tailwind CSS | Styling | ✅ UI library |
| Flowbite | Modal component | ✅ UI library |

### New Technologies

**None** - This feature introduces zero new dependencies

### Prohibited Technologies Avoided

✅ No class components (functional components only)
✅ No file-based routing (React Router action via useFetcher)
✅ No useEffect for data fetching (useFetcher pattern)
✅ No client-side state for server data (loaders + optimistic updates)
✅ No localStorage for JWT (httpOnly cookies)

---

## Constitution Compliance

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY COMPLIANT** with all 5 principles

### Principle Validation

1. **Principle 1 (Functional Programming)** ✅
   - Pure functions: `deleteTweet(db, tweetId, userId)`
   - No classes: All components are functional
   - Immutability: Optimistic update uses state (not mutation)

2. **Principle 2 (Type Safety)** ✅
   - TypeScript interfaces: `DeleteTweetParams`, `DeleteTweetError`
   - Zod schemas: `deleteTweetParamsSchema`, `deleteTweetErrorSchema`
   - Strict mode enabled

3. **Principle 3 (Programmatic Routing)** ✅
   - No new routes in app/routes.ts
   - Uses React Router action via useFetcher
   - DELETE handled by API endpoint

4. **Principle 4 (Security-First)** ✅
   - Authentication: JWT middleware on DELETE endpoint
   - Authorization: Ownership check in database query
   - Parameterized SQL: postgres package template literals
   - Input validation: Zod UUID validation

5. **Principle 5 (Modern React)** ✅
   - Functional components with hooks
   - useFetcher for optimistic updates (not useEffect)
   - Composition: DeleteButton + DeleteConfirmationModal
   - No client state for server data

## Implementation Plan

### Phase Breakdown

| Phase | Tasks | Time Estimate | Status |
|-------|-------|---------------|--------|
| Phase 1 | Backend DELETE API | 60 minutes | Ready |
| Phase 2 | Frontend components | 90 minutes | Ready |
| Phase 3 | Integration | 30 minutes | Ready |
| Phase 4 | Testing & polish | 60 minutes | Ready |
| **Total** | | **3-4 hours** | **Ready** |

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Hard Delete** (not soft delete)
   - Simpler MVP implementation
   - Meets user expectation (content gone when deleted)
   - P2: Can add undo/soft delete later if needed

2. **Optimistic UI Updates**
   - React Router useFetcher pattern
   - Tweet disappears immediately on confirmation
   - Reverts if deletion fails

3. **Single Query for Ownership + Deletion**
   - Atomic operation (prevents TOCTOU)
   - Efficient (one database roundtrip)
   - Secure (no timing-based ownership leak)

4. **Database CASCADE for Likes**
   - FK constraint handles cascade automatically
   - No N+1 queries
   - Atomic transaction

---

## Files Ready for Implementation

### Backend Files

- `src/db/tweets.ts` - Add `deleteTweet` function
- `src/schemas/tweet.ts` - Add `deleteTweetParamsSchema`
- `src/routes/tweets.ts` - Add `DELETE /:id` endpoint
- `tests/db/tweets.test.ts` - Test `deleteTweet`
- `tests/integration/tweets.test.ts` - Test DELETE endpoint

### Frontend Files

- `app/components/DeleteConfirmationModal.tsx` - New component
- `app/components/DeleteButton.tsx` - New component
- `app/components/TweetCard.tsx` - Modify (add delete button)
- `app/pages/Feed.tsx` - Pass currentUserId to TweetCard
- `app/pages/Profile.tsx` - Pass currentUserId to TweetCard
- `app/pages/TweetDetail.tsx` - Pass currentUserId to TweetCard
- `tests/components/DeleteConfirmationModal.test.tsx` - Test modal
- `tests/components/DeleteButton.test.tsx` - Test button

---

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

All acceptance criteria from spec.md addressed in plan:

### Primary User Story
- ✅ Delete button appears ONLY on own tweets - Plan: Conditional render based on `currentUserId === tweet.author.id`
- ✅ Confirmation modal before deletion - Plan: DeleteConfirmationModal component with tweet preview
- ✅ Tweet removed from database permanently - Plan: `DELETE FROM tweets WHERE id = $1 AND profile_id = $2`
- ✅ Optimistic UI update - Plan: useFetcher pattern, tweet disappears immediately
- ✅ Error handling with retry - Plan: Error toast, revert optimistic update
- ✅ Authorization enforced - Plan: Ownership check in database query

### Error Handling (US-2)
- ✅ "Tweet not found" for already-deleted tweets - Plan: 404 response
- ✅ "Not authorized" for unowned tweets - Plan: 404 response (prevents ownership leak)
- ✅ Network error handling - Plan: Revert optimistic update, error toast
- ✅ Revert on failure - Plan: `fetcher.data.error` check

### Confirmation Safety (US-3)
- ✅ Modal shows tweet content - Plan: DeleteConfirmationModal displays `tweetContent` prop
- ✅ Clear Delete/Cancel buttons - Plan: Flowbite Button components
- ✅ ESC/click-outside closes modal - Plan: Flowbite Modal default behavior
- ✅ Keyboard accessible - Plan: Focus trap, Enter/ESC keys

---

## Risk Assessment

All risks identified and mitigated:

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Accidental deletion | Medium | Confirmation modal required (no bypass) |
| Race condition | Low | Disable button while submitting |
| Network failure | Low | Revert optimistic update, error toast |
| TOCTOU attack | Medium | Single atomic query |
| Cascade failure | High | Database FK constraint (atomic) |

---

## Performance Validation

**Expected Performance:**
- Database DELETE: < 20ms (indexed primary key + cascade)
- API roundtrip: < 100ms (total)
- Optimistic UI update: < 16ms (single frame)
- **Total user-perceived time:** Instant (optimistic) + < 500ms (confirmation)

**No performance concerns** - Feature meets all performance requirements

---

## Accessibility Validation

**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:**
- ✅ Semantic HTML (button, dialog)
- ✅ ARIA labels (`aria-label="Delete tweet"`)
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, ESC)
- ✅ Focus trap in modal
- ✅ Color contrast (red button meets standards)
- ✅ Screen reader support

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Review plan** with maintainer (if required)
2. **Generate tasks** with `/specswarm:tasks`
3. **Begin implementation** following quickstart.md

### Implementation Order

1. Start with Phase 1 (Backend) - establishes foundation
2. Move to Phase 2 (Frontend components) - builds UI
3. Phase 3 (Integration) - connects everything
4. Phase 4 (Testing) - validates feature

### Quality Gates

- ✅ All tests must pass before moving to next phase
- ✅ TypeScript must compile with no errors
- ✅ Manual testing checklist completed
- ✅ Accessibility testing passed
