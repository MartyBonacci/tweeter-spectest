# Specification Quality Checklist: Tweet Deletion

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes:**
- ✅ Specification focuses on user needs (delete own tweets, confirmation modal, error handling)
- ✅ Technical Requirements section appropriately scoped (TypeScript, Zod, security) without prescribing implementation
- ✅ Business value clear: user control over their content
- ✅ All required template sections present and completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes:**
- ✅ No clarification markers found (all decisions made with documented assumptions)
- ✅ All requirements have clear acceptance criteria (e.g., "Delete button appears ONLY on tweets authored by current user")
- ✅ Success metrics are measurable: "Users can delete within 3 clicks", "Delete completes in < 500ms", "Error rate < 1%"
- ✅ Success criteria are user-focused, not implementation-focused
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios cover primary flow + error handling + confirmation safety (3 user stories)
- ✅ Edge cases documented: unauthorized deletion, tweet not found, network errors, cascade deletion
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded with "Won't Have" section (no bulk deletion, no admin deletion, no archive)
- ✅ Dependencies identified: authentication system, existing TweetCard, React Router fetcher

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes:**
- ✅ Each P0 requirement has testable criteria (delete button visibility, modal behavior, API response, optimistic update, database deletion)
- ✅ User flows documented step-by-step for delete action (9 steps from viewing tweet to error handling)
- ✅ Success metrics directly tie to user value: 3-click deletion, < 500ms completion, < 1% error rate
- ✅ Specification maintains appropriate abstraction level (describes WHAT and WHY, not HOW to implement)

## Notes

**Assumptions Made (documented in spec):**
1. Hard delete chosen over soft delete for MVP simplicity
2. Only likes cascade (other features will handle their own cascade logic)
3. No rate limiting needed (deleting own content is legitimate)

**Risk Assessment:**
- Low risk: Feature uses existing patterns (React Router actions, database operations, JWT auth)
- Security well-defined: ownership validation, parameterized queries, CSRF protection
- No blocking dependencies

**Ready for Next Phase:** ✅ YES - Specification is complete and ready for `/specswarm:plan`

---

**Status:** ✅ **ALL CHECKS PASSED** - Specification approved for planning phase
