# Specification Quality Checklist: User Authentication System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - **Status:** PASS - Spec focuses on requirements, not implementation (mentions concepts like "secure cookies" and "password hashing" but not specific libraries like JWT or argon2)

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - **Status:** PASS - User stories clearly articulate user needs and benefits

- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - **Status:** PASS - Uses business language, explains security concepts without deep technical jargon

- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - **Status:** PASS - All template sections filled with relevant content

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - **Status:** PASS - Zero clarification markers; all decisions made with documented assumptions

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - **Status:** PASS - Each requirement has clear acceptance criteria and measurable outcomes

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - **Status:** PASS - Includes specific metrics (60 seconds for signup, 100% session persistence, 0 vulnerabilities)

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - **Status:** PASS - Success metrics focus on user experience and outcomes, not technical implementation

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - **Status:** PASS - Signup, signin, signout flows fully documented with step-by-step acceptance criteria

- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - **Status:** PASS - Covers duplicate usernames/emails, invalid credentials, session persistence, validation errors

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - **Status:** PASS - "Won't Have" section explicitly excludes OAuth, 2FA, password reset, account deletion

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - **Status:** PASS - Dependencies section lists database/UUID requirements; Assumptions section documents 6 key assumptions

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - **Status:** PASS - Each P0 requirement includes success condition and testable criteria

- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - **Status:** PASS - Three user stories cover signup, signin, signout with complete acceptance criteria

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - **Status:** PASS - Success metrics align with functional requirements and user stories

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - **Status:** PASS - Spec maintains technology-agnostic language throughout (mentions "secure session tokens" not "JWT", "password hashing" not "argon2")

## Quality Score: 100/100

**All validation items passed âœ“**

---

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- Zero clarifications needed - all decisions made with reasonable defaults
- Assumptions section documents 6 key design decisions
- Security analysis comprehensive without leaking implementation details
- Recommended next step: `/spectest:plan`
