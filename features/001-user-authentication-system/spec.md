# Feature Specification: User Authentication System

**Feature ID:** 001-user-authentication-system
**Created:** 2025-10-12
**Status:** draft
**Priority:** critical

---

## Constitution Alignment

This specification MUST comply with project constitution (`/memory/constitution.md`).

**Affected Principles:**
- [x] Principle 1: Functional Programming Over OOP
- [x] Principle 2: Type Safety (TypeScript + Zod)
- [x] Principle 3: Programmatic Routing
- [x] Principle 4: Security-First Architecture
- [x] Principle 5: Modern React Patterns

**Compliance Statement:**
This authentication feature is foundational to the application's security architecture and must strictly adhere to all constitutional principles. Authentication logic will be implemented as pure functions (Principle 1). All user inputs and API boundaries will have strict type definitions and runtime validation (Principle 2). Signup/signin/signout pages will be defined programmatically in the centralized routing configuration (Principle 3). Password storage, session management, and input sanitization will follow industry-standard security practices (Principle 4). Authentication UI will use functional components with form handling through framework actions (Principle 5).

---

## Summary

**What:** A secure user authentication system enabling account creation, login, and logout.

**Why:** Users need to establish their identity to access personalized features, post content, and maintain account privacy.

**Who:** All Tweeter users (both new users creating accounts and existing users returning to the platform).

---

## User Stories

### Primary User Story: New User Signup
```
As a new visitor to Tweeter
I want to create an account with my username, email, and password
So that I can access the platform and post tweets
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can enter username, email, and password in a signup form
- [ ] System validates inputs and shows clear error messages for invalid data
- [ ] User receives immediate feedback if username or email is already taken
- [ ] Upon successful signup, user is automatically signed in
- [ ] User is redirected to the main feed after signup

### Secondary User Story: Returning User Signin
```
As a returning Tweeter user
I want to sign in with my email and password
So that I can access my account and continue using the platform
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can enter email and password in a signin form
- [ ] System validates credentials without revealing which field is incorrect (security)
- [ ] Upon successful signin, user is redirected to the main feed
- [ ] Failed signin attempts show generic error message
- [ ] User session persists across browser refreshes until signout

### Secondary User Story: User Signout
```
As a signed-in Tweeter user
I want to sign out of my account
So that others using my device cannot access my account
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can trigger signout from any page while authenticated
- [ ] Session is immediately terminated upon signout
- [ ] User is redirected to the landing page after signout
- [ ] Attempting to access protected pages after signout redirects to signin

---

## Functional Requirements

### Must Have (P0)

1. **User Registration**
   - System accepts username (unique), email (unique), and password
   - Username must be alphanumeric with optional hyphens/underscores
   - Email must be valid email format
   - Password must meet minimum security requirements (8+ characters)
   - System prevents duplicate usernames and emails
   - Success: User account created and user automatically signed in

2. **User Authentication**
   - System accepts email and password for signin
   - Credentials are verified securely
   - Invalid credentials return generic error (no indication of which field failed)
   - Success: User session established and user redirected to feed

3. **Session Management**
   - User session persists across page reloads and browser tabs
   - Session stored securely (cannot be stolen via client-side scripts)
   - Session automatically associates user identity with subsequent requests
   - Session expires after 30 days of inactivity (reasonable default)

4. **User Signout**
   - User can explicitly end their session
   - Signout immediately invalidates session
   - After signout, protected routes redirect to signin page

5. **Input Validation**
   - All form inputs validated before submission (client-side for UX)
   - All inputs validated on server (server-side for security)
   - Clear, actionable error messages displayed for validation failures
   - Form prevents submission with invalid data

6. **Password Security**
   - Passwords stored securely (never in plaintext)
   - Password hashing uses modern, industry-standard algorithms
   - Passwords never logged or exposed in responses

7. **Route Protection**
   - Unauthenticated users redirected to signin when accessing protected routes
   - Authenticated users can access all protected features
   - Signin/signup pages redirect to feed if user already authenticated

### Should Have (P1)

1. **Password Strength Indicator**
   - Visual feedback on password strength during signup
   - Suggestions for improving weak passwords

2. **Remember Me** (extended session)
   - Option to extend session duration beyond default 30 days
   - Session extended to 90 days when "remember me" selected

### Could Have (P2)

1. **Email Verification**
   - Send verification email after signup
   - Require email verification before full account access

2. **Password Reset Flow**
   - Forgot password link on signin page
   - Email-based password reset process

### Won't Have (Out of Scope)

1. OAuth/Social Login (Google, GitHub, etc.)
2. Two-factor authentication (2FA)
3. Account recovery questions
4. Username changes after account creation
5. Account deletion

## Technical Requirements

### Type Safety Requirements
- [x] TypeScript interfaces defined for all data structures (User, Session, Auth requests/responses)
- [x] Zod schemas created for:
  - [x] Signup request validation (username, email, password)
  - [x] Signin request validation (email, password)
  - [x] API response validation (user data, error messages)
  - [x] Form input validation (real-time feedback)

### Security Requirements
- [x] Authentication method: Secure session tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies
- [x] Authorization rules: Authenticated users access feed/profiles/settings, unauthenticated users access only landing/signin/signup
- [x] Input sanitization: All user inputs validated and sanitized before database operations
- [x] Data protection: Passwords hashed before storage, tokens stored in secure cookies, no sensitive data in client storage

### Data Requirements
- [x] Database schema changes documented: profiles table created
- [x] Migration strategy defined: Initial migration creates profiles table with indexes
- [x] Data validation rules specified: username/email uniqueness, password minimum length
- [x] snake_case ↔ camelCase mapping identified: password_hash (DB) ↔ passwordHash (app), created_at ↔ createdAt

### Routing Requirements
- [x] Routes added to `app/routes.ts`: /signup, /signin, and / (landing)
- [x] Loader functions defined: Redirect authenticated users from signin/signup to feed
- [x] Action functions defined: Signup action, signin action, signout action
- [x] No file-based routes created: All routes in centralized configuration

## User Interface

### Pages/Views

1. **Landing Page** (`/`)
   - Purpose: Welcome page with signup/signin options for unauthenticated users
   - Components: Hero section, signup CTA button, signin link
   - Data: No data needed (static content)

2. **Signup Page** (`/signup`)
   - Purpose: New user account creation
   - Components: SignupForm with username, email, password fields
   - Data: None on load; form submission creates user via action

3. **Signin Page** (`/signin`)
   - Purpose: Existing user authentication
   - Components: SigninForm with email, password fields
   - Data: None on load; form submission authenticates user via action

### Components

1. **SignupForm** (functional component)
   - Props: None (uses form action)
   - State: Form validation errors (local state with hooks)
   - Behavior: Real-time validation, submission via framework action, displays validation errors

2. **SigninForm** (functional component)
   - Props: None (uses form action)
   - State: Form validation errors (local state with hooks)
   - Behavior: Real-time validation, submission via framework action, displays authentication errors

3. **SignoutButton** (functional component)
   - Props: None (uses form action)
   - State: None
   - Behavior: Triggers signout action when clicked

### User Flows

#### Signup Flow
```
1. User navigates to /signup
2. User sees signup form (username, email, password fields)
3. User enters information
4. System validates inputs in real-time (client-side)
5. User submits form
6. Action validates inputs (server-side)
7. If valid: User account created, session established, redirect to /feed
8. If invalid: Error messages displayed, user corrects and resubmits
```

#### Signin Flow
```
1. User navigates to /signin
2. User sees signin form (email, password fields)
3. User enters credentials
4. User submits form
5. Action validates credentials (server-side)
6. If valid: Session established, redirect to /feed
7. If invalid: Generic error displayed ("Invalid credentials"), user retries
```

#### Signout Flow
```
1. User clicks signout button (available in navigation)
2. Action terminates session
3. User redirected to / (landing page)
4. Subsequent attempts to access protected routes redirect to /signin
```

## Data Model

### Database Schema

#### Table: profiles
```sql
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v7(),
  username VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  bio VARCHAR(160),
  avatar_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Indexes:**
- [x] Unique index on `username` for fast lookup and uniqueness enforcement
- [x] Unique index on `email` for fast lookup and uniqueness enforcement
- [x] Index on `created_at` for potential analytics queries

**Constraints:**
- [x] `username` UNIQUE NOT NULL (prevents duplicate usernames)
- [x] `email` UNIQUE NOT NULL (prevents duplicate emails)
- [x] `password_hash` NOT NULL (all accounts must have password)

**Relationships:**
- [x] No foreign keys in this feature (foundation for future tweets/likes relationships)

### TypeScript Interfaces
```typescript
// Application layer (camelCase)
interface User {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  email: string;
  passwordHash: string;  // Never exposed in API responses
  bio: string | null;
  avatarUrl: string | null;
  createdAt: Date;
}

// Public user data (safe to send to client)
interface PublicUser {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  email: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

## Security Analysis

### Threat Model

1. **Credential Theft via XSS**
   - **Threat:** Attacker injects malicious JavaScript to steal session tokens
   - **Mitigation:** Session tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies (inaccessible to JavaScript)

2. **Brute Force Password Attacks**
   - **Threat:** Attacker attempts many passwords to gain access
   - **Mitigation:** Strong password hashing (computationally expensive), rate limiting on signin endpoint (future enhancement)

3. **SQL Injection**
   - **Threat:** Attacker manipulates database queries via malicious input
   - **Mitigation:** All database queries use parameterized statements, input validation prevents malicious characters

4. **Password Exposure in Logs**
   - **Threat:** Passwords accidentally logged and exposed
   - **Mitigation:** Password field excluded from all logging, never returned in API responses

5. **Session Hijacking**
   - **Threat:** Attacker steals session token to impersonate user
   - **Mitigation:** Secure cookie flags (httpOnly, secure, sameSite), token rotation (future enhancement)

6. **User Enumeration**
   - **Threat:** Attacker determines valid usernames/emails by observing error messages
   - **Mitigation:** Generic error messages on signin ("Invalid credentials" not "User not found"), timing-constant comparison

### Input Validation
- [x] All user inputs validated with schema validation before processing
- [x] SQL injection prevented via parameterized queries (no string concatenation in queries)
- [x] XSS prevented via framework auto-escaping and input validation

### Authentication & Authorization
- [x] Session tokens stored in httpOnly cookies only (never localStorage or sessionStorage)
- [x] Protected routes check for valid session before rendering
- [x] Authorization middleware verifies session on all protected API endpoints

---

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [x] Password hashing function tested (verify hash generation, hash verification)
- [x] Validation schemas tested with valid/invalid inputs
- [x] Session utility functions tested (token generation, verification)
- [x] Form components tested for rendering and validation display

### Integration Tests
- [x] POST /api/auth/signup tested with valid data (success case)
- [x] POST /api/auth/signup tested with duplicate username/email (conflict cases)
- [x] POST /api/auth/signin tested with valid credentials (success case)
- [x] POST /api/auth/signin tested with invalid credentials (failure cases)
- [x] POST /api/auth/signout tested (session termination)
- [x] Protected route access tested (with and without authentication)

### End-to-End Tests
- [x] Complete signup flow (form entry → submission → redirect to feed)
- [x] Complete signin flow (form entry → submission → redirect to feed)
- [x] Complete signout flow (signout → redirect to landing → protected route blocked)
- [x] Session persistence (reload page while authenticated → still authenticated)
- [x] Error handling (invalid inputs show errors, failed signin shows error)

---

## Performance Considerations

- [x] Database queries use indexes on username/email for fast lookups
- [x] Password hashing uses appropriate work factor (balance security vs performance)
- [x] Session validation optimized (cached or fast lookup mechanism)
- [x] Form validation runs on client before server (reduces unnecessary requests)

---

## Accessibility

- [x] Semantic HTML form elements used (label, input, button)
- [x] ARIA labels for form fields ("Username", "Email address", "Password")
- [x] Keyboard navigation supported (tab through form fields, enter to submit)
- [x] Error messages associated with fields (aria-describedby)
- [x] Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards for all text and form elements

---

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- [x] Database connection configured (PostgreSQL via Neon)
- [x] UUID v7 generation available
- [x] Express server configured

**External Services:**
- [x] PostgreSQL database (Neon hosted)

**Blocking Issues:**
- None

---

## Success Metrics

**How we'll measure success:**
- [ ] Users can complete signup in under 60 seconds
- [ ] 0 password-related security vulnerabilities detected
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met for signup, signin, and signout flows
- [ ] Session persistence works across 100% of browser refresh scenarios
- [ ] Form validation prevents 100% of invalid submissions from reaching server

---

## Assumptions

1. **Session Duration:** 30-day session expiration is reasonable default for a social media platform (balances convenience and security)
2. **Username Format:** Alphanumeric with hyphens/underscores covers majority of desired usernames without complexity
3. **Password Minimum:** 8 characters is industry-standard minimum for reasonable security
4. **Error Granularity:** Generic signin errors acceptable for security (user enumeration prevention outweighs UX convenience)
5. **Email Verification:** Not required for MVP; users can post immediately after signup
6. **Rate Limiting:** Not included in initial implementation; can be added later if abuse detected
