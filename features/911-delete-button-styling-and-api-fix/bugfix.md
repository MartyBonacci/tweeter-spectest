# Bug 911: Delete Tweet Button Invisible and Deletion Fails

**Status**: Active
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Priority**: High
**Severity**: Major

## Symptoms

Two distinct bugs affecting tweet deletion:

1. **UI Bug**: Delete button in confirmation modal has white text on white background (invisible)
2. **Functional Bug**: Clicking delete shows error "Oops! Something went wrong", page refreshes, tweet remains in database

## Reproduction Steps

1. Sign in as a user
2. Create a tweet
3. Click trash icon on your own tweet
4. Modal appears with invisible delete button
5. Click where delete button should be
6. Error appears, page refreshes, tweet still exists

**Expected Behavior**:
- Delete button should be visible with red background and white text
- Clicking delete should remove tweet from database
- Tweet should disappear from UI immediately (optimistic update)
- No error message should appear

**Actual Behavior**:
- Delete button text is invisible (white on white)
- Deletion fails with generic error
- Tweet remains in database
- Page refreshes unexpectedly

## Root Cause Analysis

### Bug #1: Invisible Delete Button (UI)

**Component**: `app/components/DeleteConfirmationModal.tsx`
**Location**: Line 42-48
**Issue**: Flowbite Button with `color="failure"` is not rendering with proper styling

**Root Cause**: The Flowbite React Button component's `color="failure"` prop may not be properly configured or the Flowbite theme isn't loading correctly. Need to verify Flowbite installation and add explicit className overrides if needed.

### Bug #2: Delete API Routing Failure (Functional)

**Component**: `app/components/DeleteButton.tsx`
**Location**: Line 47-50
**Issue**: `fetcher.submit()` with action `/api/tweets/${tweetId}` is not correctly routing to the Express DELETE endpoint

**Root Cause**: React Router `useFetcher()` requires a route action to be defined in the router configuration. The action URL `/api/tweets/:id` points to an Express API endpoint, but React Router fetcher doesn't directly call Express endpoints - it needs a React Router action function that proxies to the API.

**Secondary Issue**: The error handling in lines 30-42 checks `fetcher.data.error`, but a successful 204 No Content response won't have `data`, causing the success path to not execute properly.

## Impact Assessment

**Affected Users**: All authenticated users trying to delete their own tweets

**Affected Features**:
- Tweet deletion (Feature 910): Completely broken
- User content management: Unable to remove unwanted tweets

**Severity Justification**: High priority because:
- Core feature completely non-functional
- Affects all users
- No workaround available
- Poor user experience (invisible button, confusing errors)

**Workaround Available**: No - users cannot delete tweets

## Regression Test Requirements

1. **UI Test**: Render DeleteConfirmationModal and verify delete button is visible with red background
2. **Integration Test**: Test DELETE /api/tweets/:id endpoint directly with valid auth token
3. **Component Test**: Test DeleteButton component's delete flow with mocked fetcher

**Test Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Test fails before fix (proves bug exists)
- ✅ Test passes after fix (proves bug fixed)
- ✅ No new regressions introduced

## Proposed Solution

### Fix #1: Invisible Delete Button

**File**: `app/components/DeleteConfirmationModal.tsx`

**Change**: Add explicit Tailwind classes to override Flowbite styling:
```tsx
<Button
  color="failure"
  onClick={onConfirm}
  disabled={isDeleting}
  className="bg-red-600 text-white hover:bg-red-700 focus:ring-4 focus:ring-red-300"
>
  {isDeleting ? 'Deleting...' : 'Delete'}
</Button>
```

**Alternative**: Check if Flowbite theme is properly configured in tailwind.config.js

### Fix #2: Delete API Routing

**File**: `app/components/DeleteButton.tsx`

**Change Option A (Recommended)**: Use native fetch instead of useFetcher for external API calls:
```tsx
const handleDelete = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/tweets/${tweetId}`, {
      method: 'DELETE',
      credentials: 'include', // Include cookies for auth
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      setIsModalOpen(false);
      onDeleteSuccess?.();
    } else {
      const errorData = await response.json().catch(() => ({ error: 'Failed to delete tweet' }));
      console.error('Delete failed:', errorData.error);
      // Show error toast
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Delete error:', error);
    // Show error toast
  }
};
```

**Change Option B**: Create a React Router action in the route config that proxies to the API (more complex, maintains useFetcher pattern)

**Risks**:
- Option A: Moves away from useFetcher pattern, but simpler and works directly with Express API
- Option B: More aligned with React Router patterns, but requires route configuration changes

**Alternative Approaches**:
- Could refactor to use React Router data APIs entirely (loader/action pattern)
- Could keep useFetcher but add a proxy route action

**Chosen Approach**: Option A (native fetch) for simplicity and immediate fix
