**Commit:** 4d58696e22ce4ad96f8213a365489d6d8ad94c64
**Branch:** main

### Current Task
Testing ConvoSync's ability to preserve conversation context across multiple devices and sync cycles by repeatedly updating a test file and syncing sessions.

### Progress So Far
- ✅ Successfully restored ConvoSync session from another device (2.5MB conversation)
- ✅ Completed password reset debugging work (Bug 916 & Bug 917)
- ✅ Created diagnostic tools for password reset troubleshooting
- ✅ Performed 9 test file updates to verify context preservation
- ✅ Synced sessions multiple times across devices

### Key Decisions Made
- **Context Test Method**: Using repeated file updates with memorable context (favorite pizza) to verify conversation context persists across device syncs
- **Test File Pattern**: Each update uses a pizza-related variant ("Pizza", "Pizza Pie", "Pizzaria", etc.) to make it easy to verify context preservation
- **No File Storage for Context**: Intentionally storing the "favorite pizza" fact only in conversation memory (not in any file) to prove context sync works

### Important Context
- **User's Favorite Pizza**: Pepperoni and mushrooms (stored in conversation context only, not in files)
- **Test File History**: test-sync.md has been updated 9 times:
  1. "hello from phone 1" → "Pizza"
  2. "Pizza" → "Pizza Pie"
  3. "Pizza Pie" → "Pizzaria"
  4. "Pizzaria" → "Pi"
  5. "Pi" → "Pizzzzza"
  6. "Pizzzzza" → "Piza"
  7. "Piza" → "Piiiiizzzzaaaaa"
  8. "Piiiiizzzzaaaaa" → "PiZa"
  9. "PiZa" → "PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPizza"

### Next Steps
1. Complete the current ConvoSync save with the handoff
2. Resume session on another device to verify:
   - Can recall "favorite pizza is pepperoni and mushrooms" without reading any files
   - Can recall current test-sync.md content is "PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPizza" without reading it
   - Full conversation history is visible
3. Continue testing cross-device context preservation if needed

### Files Modified
- test-sync.md (+1, -1) - Updated content from "PiZa" to "PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPizza" for 9th context preservation test
- PASSWORD-RESET-DEBUGGING.md (+195) - Created comprehensive debugging guide for password reset issues
- QUICK-START-DIAGNOSIS.md (+87) - Created quick reference guide for password reset diagnosis
- diagnose-password-reset.ts (+218) - Created diagnostic tool to analyze password reset token state

### Open Questions
- None - this is a straightforward ConvoSync context preservation test
- Password reset debugging is complete with both Bug 916 and Bug 917 fixed
