## Task Categorization

Tasks are organized by constitutional principle to ensure comprehensive compliance.

### Legend
- `[ ]` Not started
- `[~]` In progress
- `[x]` Completed
- `[!]` Blocked

---

## Setup & Foundation

### Environment & Dependencies
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Install required dependencies
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Review constitution for compliance requirements

---

## Principle 1: Functional Programming

### Pure Functions & Composition
- [ ] Identify all business logic functions
- [ ] Implement functions as pure (no side effects)
- [ ] Use function composition for complex logic
- [ ] Create factory functions instead of classes
- [ ] Test functions with various inputs

**Validation Checkpoint:**
- [ ] No class declarations (except library integration)
- [ ] No `this` keyword usage
- [ ] All functions have explicit inputs/outputs

---

## Principle 2: Type Safety (TypeScript + Zod)

### Type Definitions
- [ ] Define TypeScript interfaces for data structures
- [ ] Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json
- [ ] Add type annotations to all functions
- [ ] Eliminate any `any` types (or document exceptions)

### Zod Schemas
- [ ] Create Zod schemas for API requests
- [ ] Create Zod schemas for API responses
- [ ] Create Zod schemas for form inputs
- [ ] Create Zod schemas for external data
- [ ] Add Zod validation to all data boundaries

### Frontend Validation (UX)
- [ ] Integrate Zod with form libraries
- [ ] Display validation errors to users
- [ ] Validate before submission

### Backend Validation (Security)
- [ ] Validate all API request payloads
- [ ] Return 400 errors for invalid data
- [ ] Log validation failures for monitoring

**Validation Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Build passes with no TypeScript errors
- [ ] All boundaries have Zod schemas
- [ ] Validation tested with invalid inputs

---

## Principle 3: Programmatic Routing

### Route Configuration
- [ ] Define routes in `app/routes.ts`
- [ ] Add RouteConfig entries for new pages
- [ ] Define loader functions for data fetching
- [ ] Define action functions for mutations
- [ ] Test route navigation

**Validation Checkpoint:**
- [ ] No route files outside `app/routes.ts`
- [ ] All routes use RouteConfig
- [ ] No file-based routing patterns

---

## Principle 4: Security-First Architecture

### Authentication
- [ ] Implement JWT token generation (if needed)
- [ ] Store tokens in httpOnly cookies
- [ ] Add authentication middleware to protected routes
- [ ] Test authentication flows

### Authorization
- [ ] Define authorization rules
- [ ] Implement authorization checks
- [ ] Test unauthorized access scenarios

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- [ ] Validate all user inputs with Zod
- [ ] Sanitize inputs before database operations
- [ ] Use parameterized queries (no string concatenation)
- [ ] Test with malicious inputs

### Password Security (if applicable)
- [ ] Use @node-rs/argon2 for hashing
- [ ] Never log or expose passwords
- [ ] Test password hashing/verification

### Data Protection
- [ ] Identify sensitive data
- [ ] Ensure no sensitive data in localStorage
- [ ] Implement proper access controls
- [ ] Test data access permissions

**Validation Checkpoint:**
- [ ] No JWT in localStorage
- [ ] All protected routes authenticated
- [ ] Database queries parameterized
- [ ] Security test scenarios pass

---

## Principle 5: Modern React Patterns

### Components
- [ ] Implement functional components (no classes)
- [ ] Use hooks for state management
- [ ] Create custom hooks for reusable logic
- [ ] Use composition (props.children, render props)
- [ ] Avoid prop drilling (use context if needed)

### Data Fetching
- [ ] Fetch data via loaders (not useEffect)
- [ ] Handle loading states properly
- [ ] Handle error states properly
- [ ] Optimize data fetching performance

### Forms
- [ ] Implement controlled components
- [ ] Use React Router actions for submissions
- [ ] Integrate with Zod validation
- [ ] Handle form errors gracefully

**Validation Checkpoint:**
- [ ] No class components
- [ ] Data fetching uses loaders/actions
- [ ] Custom hooks follow naming convention (use*)
- [ ] No excessive prop drilling

---

## Database Operations

### Schema Changes
- [ ] Write database migration
- [ ] Test migration up and down
- [ ] Update TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Verify snake_case â†” camelCase mapping

### Queries
- [ ] Implement database queries
- [ ] Use parameterized queries
- [ ] Add appropriate indexes
- [ ] Test query performance

**Validation Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Migrations tested
- [ ] Queries use proper case mapping
- [ ] No N+1 query problems

---

## API Implementation

### Backend Endpoints
- [ ] Implement Express route handlers
- [ ] Add request validation (Zod)
- [ ] Add response validation (Zod)
- [ ] Implement business logic (pure functions)
- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Write API tests

**Validation Checkpoint:**
- [ ] All endpoints have Zod validation
- [ ] Error responses standardized
- [ ] API tests cover success and error cases

---

## Frontend Implementation

### UI Components
- [ ] Implement page components
- [ ] Implement reusable UI components
- [ ] Add Tailwind CSS styling
- [ ] Ensure responsive design
- [ ] Test component rendering

### User Flows
- [ ] Implement primary user flow
- [ ] Implement secondary flows
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Add error states
- [ ] Add empty states

**Validation Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Components follow functional patterns
- [ ] UI matches design requirements
- [ ] User flows tested end-to-end

---

## Testing
